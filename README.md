PROFESSIONALS AND CLIENTS: MODELS AND METAPHORS

the selections in chapter 3 began our approach to the question of the rights and responsibilities of professionals when they are functioning in their occupational roles. The present chapter carries that inquiry forward by asking how we are to understand the special moral relationship which obtains between professionals and those whose interests they are engaged to serve. Though simply stated, this question is enormously complex: For the relationships which are of philosophical interest to us here range from relationships like that between a self-employed physician and his or her clients, through that between a hospital-employed nurse and the hospital-as well as the nurse's clients-to relationships between scientific advisors and their employers (including the federal government) and to relationships between engineers and the corporations which employ them as well as the public whose interests they are supposed to protect by ensuring safe designs. 

Despite this great variety in employment relationships, there is a question implicitly raised by the readings in chapter 3 that pertains to all of them, namely, whether the engaged professional is to function solely as an agent in pursuit of his or her principal's interests, whether that principal is an individual person; or a local, state, or federal government; or some other corporate employer. In the context of legal practice, we have already seen Monroe Freedman defending what Michael Bayles in this chapter's reading calls the 'agency' model of the professional/principal relationship. Although Bayles limits his treatment of the professional/principal relationship to what he has called 'the consulting professions' (see sel. 1 in chap. 2), the agency model need not be limited in application to those professions. As a professional /principal model, it is also utilizable in thinking about professional responsibility in the employer/employee relationship even when the employers are as diverse in kind as those mentioned above. In chapter 10, for example, we shall see Milton Friedman arguing that the single moral responsibility of business managers is to maximize profits within the limits of law for the shareholders who have entrusted them with their funds. 

The present chapter, however, addresses the question of the professional/principal relationship by focusing on the relationship between professionals and clients in several of the service professions, namely, medicine, nursing, and higher education. The candidates which emerge in this chapter as models to be captured in these relationships are contract, covenant, advocate, and fiduciary. It may well be the case that these models are not mutually exclusive. And it may also be the case that no single model will be appropriate to serve as the standard across all the service professions (or the professions Bayles categorizes as the consulting professions). And it may also be the case that no single model fully captures all we want to capture in any one profession. Still, reflecting on the models and metaphors suggested in these readings can be useful in thinking through the rights and responsibilities of professionals toward their clients。

Central to our focus in this chapter is the question of power distribution in the professional client relationship. As Richard Wasserstrom's article in chapter 3 pointed out, the lawyer/client relationship seems to have a decidedly paternalistic component. This component has not been limited to relationships between attorneys and principals. Indeed, some would argue that paternalism has traditionally been one of the clearest characteristics of the health care professions and education (even at its highest levels), among others. But paternalism, as Bayles points out, strips clients of important rights to self-direction. The following articles by Robert Veatch and William May reject a paternalistic model for medicine. Veatch supports a contract model. which incorporates respect for patient autonomy. But May contends that the contract model fails to capture important features of the physician/patient relationship, and he attempts to improve on the contract model by suggesting that the relationship between physicians and their patients should be more richly understood as covenant. 

The article by Gerald Winslow addresses a metaphor which has recently been widely supported as providing the appropriate model for nursing, namely, the advocacy model. As Wins low points out, the advocacy model in nursing has its roots in law and is an interesting derivative of the agency model in legal practice. The advocacy model in nursing takes protection of the moral rights of patients to be central to nursing practice. suggesting that nurses are to assume the role of "moral watchdog" for patients in the health care system. Winslow traces the development of this metaphor in nursing and shows the obstacles nursing will need to overcome if nurses are to become effective patient advocates. 

My own article addresses the question of whether the relationship between professors and students in higher education is to be understood, in any general way, as a paternalistic one. I suggest that it is not and that we would do best to understand the general structure of the ordinary relationship between professors and their students as contractual in nature. An objection to my position might be raised along the lines suggested by May in his discussion of medicine. But it is not clear to me that contract, properly understood in certain contexts, needs to be as cool and legalistic as May's criticism of the contract model suggests. What the contract model in this chapter's readings preserves are the relevant aspects of the fiduciary model proposed by Bayles as well as the social sanctions which, as Veatch points out, institutionalize and stand behind the professional/client relationship in case there is a violation of the contract. At the same time, the model assumes that professionals will, in general, faithfully and conscientiously fulfill their obligations. The contract model also avoids the identification of the professional person with his or her professional role, which seems to be involved in May's account of the covenant model. 

Implicit in all the models of the professional/client relationship proposed in this chapter is a respect for professional autonomy. which is inadequately captured in the agency (or hired-gun) model of the professional/client relationship, as well as a respect for client autonomy, which is inadequately captured in the paternalistic model of the professional/client relationship. The articles by Veatch and Bayles as well as my own article begin a direct discussion of paternalism in the professions that will continue into the first part of chapter 5, where deceiving clients for their own good is the central issue. 


10. Models for Ethical Medicine in a Revolutionary Age Robert M. Veatch

most of the ethical problems in the practice of medicine come up in cases where the medical condition or desired procedure itself presents no moral problem. Most day-to-day patient contacts are just not cases which are ethically exotic. For the woman who spends five hours in the clinic waiting room with two screaming children waiting to be seen for the flu, the flu is not a special moral problem; her wait is. When medical students practice drawing bloods from clinic patients in the cardiac care unit-when teaching material is treated as material-the moral problem is not really related to the patient's heart in the way it might be in a more exotic heart transplant. Many more blood sample are drawn, however, than hearts transplanted. It is only by moving beyond the specific issues to more basic underlying ethical themes that the real ethical problems in medicine can be dealt with 

THE ENCINEERINC MODEL

One of the impacts of the biological revolution is to make the physician scientific. All too often he behaves like an applied scientist. The rhetoric of the scientific tradition in the modern world is that the scientist must be "pure." He must be factual, divorcing himself from all considerations of value. It has taken atomic bombs and Nazi medical research to let us see the foolishness and danger of such a stance. In the first place the scientist, and certainly the applied scientist, just cannot logically be value free. Choices must be made daily-in research design, in significance levels of statistical tests, and in perception of the "significant" observations from an infinite perceptual field, and each of these choices requires a frame of values on which it is based. Even more so in an applied science like medicine choices based upon what is "significant," what is "valuable," must be made constantly. The physician who thinks he can just present all the facts and let the patient make the choices is fooling himself even if it is morally sound and responsible to do this at all the critical points where decisive choices are to be made. Furthermore, even if the physician logically could eliminate all ethical and other value considerations from his decision making and even if he could in practice conform to the impossible value-free ideal, it would be morally outrageous for him to do so. It would make him an engineer, a plumber making repairs, connecting tubes and flushing out clogged systems, with no questions asked 

THE PRIESTLY MODEL 

In proper moral revulsion to the model which makes the physician into a plumber for whom his own ethical judgments are completely excluded, some move to the opposite extreme, making the physician a new priest. Establishment sociologist of medicine Robert N. Wilson describes the physician-patient relationship as religious. "The doc- tor's office or the hospital room, for example," he says, "have somewhat the aura of a sanctuary"; "…the patient must view his doctor in a manner far removed from the prosaic and the mundane." 

The priestly model leads to what I call the "As- a syndrome." The symptoms are verbal, but the disease is moral. The chief diagnostic sign is the phrase "speaking-as-a…" In counseling a pregnant woman who has taken Thalidomide, a physician says, "The odds are against a normal baby and "speaking-as-a-physician that is a risk you shouldn't take." One must ask what it is about medical training that lets this be said "as-a-physician" rather than as a friend or as a moral man or as a priest. The problem is one of generalization of expertise: transferring of expertise in the technical aspects of a subject to expertise in moral advice. 

The main ethical principle which summarizes this priestly tradition is "Benefit and do no harm to the patient." Now attacking the principle of doing no harm to the patient is a bit like attacking fatherhood. (Motherhood has not dominated the profession in the Western tradition.) But Father- hood has long been an alternative symbol for the priestly model, "Father" has traditionally been a personalistic metaphor for God and for the priest. Likewise, the classical medical sociology literature (the same literature using the religious images) always uses the parent-child image as an analogy for the physician-patient relationship. It is this paternalism in the realm of values which is represented in the moral slogan "Benefit and do no harm to the patient." It takes the locus of decision making away from the patient and places it in the hands of the professional. In doing so it destroys or at least minimizes the other moral themes essential to a more balanced ethical system. While a professional group may affirm this principle as adequate for a professional ethic, it is clear that society, more generally, has a much broader set of ethical norms. If the professional group is affirming one norm while society affirms another for the same circumstances, then the physician is placed in the uncomfortable position of having to decide whether his loyalty is to the norms of his professional group or to those of the broader society. What would this larger set of norms include? 

Producing Good and Not Harm

Outside of the narrowest Kantian tradition, no one excludes the moral duty of producing good and avoiding harm entirely. Let this be said from the start. Some separate producing good and avoiding evil into two different principles placing greater moral weight on the latter, but this is also true within the tradition of professional medical ethics. The real difference is that in a set of ethical norms used more universally in the broader society producing good and avoiding harm is set in a much broader context and becomes just one of a much larger set of moral obligations. 

Protecting individual Freedom 

Personal freedom is a fundamental value in society. It is essential to being truly human. Individual freedom for both physician and patient must be protected even if it looks like some harm is going to be done in the process. This is why legally competent patients are permitted by society to re- fuse blood transfusions or other types of medical care even when to the vast majority of us the price seems to be one of great harm. Authority about what constitutes harm and what constitutes good (as opposed to procedures required to obtain a particular predetermined good or harm) cannot be vested in any one particular group of individuals. To do so would be to make the error of generalizing expertise. 

Preserving individual Dignity 

Equality of moral significance of all persons means that each is given fundamental dignity. Individual freedom of choice and control over one's own life and body contributes to that dignity. We might say that this more universal, societal ethic of freedom and dignity is one which moves beyond B. F. Skinner. 

Many of the steps in the hospitalization, care, and maintenance of the patient, particularly seriously ill patients are currently an assault on that dignity. The emaciated, senile man connected to life by IV tubes, tracheotomy, and colostomy has difficulty retaining his sense of dignity. Small wonder that many prefer to return to their own homes to die. It is there on their own turf that they have a sense of power and dignity. 

Truth Telling and Promise Keeping 

As traditional as they sound, the ethical obligations of truth telling and promise keeping have retained their place in ethics because they are seen as essential to the quality of human relationships. It is disturbing to see these fundamental elements of human interaction compromised, minimized, and even eliminated supposedly in order to keep from harming the patient. This is a much broader problem than the issue of what to tell the terminal. carcinoma patient or the patient for whom there has been an unanticipated discovery of an XYY chromosome pattern when doing an amniocentesis for mongolism. It arises when the young boy getting his measles shot is told "Now this won't hurt a bit" and when a medical student is introduced on the hospital floor as "Doctor." And these all may be defended as ways of keeping from harming: the patient. It is clear that in each case, also especially if one takes into account the long-range. threat to trust and confidence, that in the long run these violations of truth telling and promise keeping may do more harm than good. Both the young b getting the shot and the medical student are being taught what to expect from the medical profession in the future. But even if that were not the case each is an assault on patient dignity and freedom and humanity. Such actions may be justifiable sometimes, but the case must be awfully strong 

Maintaining and Restoring justice 

Another way in which the ethical norms of the broader society move beyond concern for helping and not harming the patient is by insisting on a fair distribution of health services. What we have been calling the social revolution, as prefigurative as it may be, has heightened our concern for equality in the distribution of basic health services. If heal care is a right, then it is a right for all. It is not enough to produce individual cases of good heal or even the best aggregate health statistics. Even if the United States had the best health statistics ' the world (which it does not have), if this were attained at the expense of inferior health care f certain groups within the society it would be ethically unacceptable. 

At this point in history with our current record of discriminatory delivery of health services there is a special concern for restoring justice. Justice must also be compensatory. The health of those, who have been discriminated against must be maintained and restored as a special priority.
