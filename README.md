The following is one example of a very good ethics paper. Note that the models and theories cited are thoroughly explained, and their implications to the case are fully explored. This paper does not, of course, represent the only way a good paper could be written, but it does demonstrate one successful strategy. Some comments pointing out the strengths of the paper are placed in the right margin

The author chooses to state the case in full in italics. An alternative would be to paraphrase the important facts of the case
Dorothy Abraham suffered from colon cancer. She was in acute pain for nearly three years. Her physician, Dr. Martha Little, prescribed a narcotic analgesic for the debilitating affliction. Abraham also experienced insomnia so Little gave her a barbiturate to help her sleep. Abraham was able to discontinue use of the analgesic, but became addicted to the sleeping drug. Realizing this addiction, Little made an arrangement with her patient's pharmacist to replace, in stages, the original barbiturate formula with a sugar substance. The barbiturate manufacturer provided the pharmacist with the empty patent capsules so Abraham would not suspect anything. The pharmacist gradually increased the sugar in the capsules while decreasing the barbiturate. After one year, Abraham was unknowingly paying full price for a placebo. The pharmacist could have easily charged Abraham more due to his labor, but knowing her financial situation, decided against it. Little still treated Abraham and wrote her the barbiturate prescription each month. Also aware of her financial status, she charged Abraham less than usual. Little also justified the cheaper rate because she thought if she did not charge Abraham, the therapeutic placebo would no longer be effective.
The pharmacist explained the situation and asked his new employee to fill the placebo prescription. The pharmacist suggested that it would be detrimental if Abraham were to find out she had been given a placebo. The new pharmacist was bothered by his boss's demand. He reasoned that the insomnia may return, she could really become addicted, and she would lose faith in her doctor. But, he was alsotroubled by the fact that Abraham was spending so much money for nothing more than sugar. The employee was not at all sure that he wanted to be a part of the scheme to deceive the woman. He found the idea of tricking Abraham to be inconsistent with his duties and demeaning to patients (Callahan 167-8).

A clearstatement ofthe ethicalissue at stake is offered.
Obviously, Abraham was deceived. Little, the first pharmacist, and the manufacturer each knowingly played a role in leading her to believing a falsehood. The issue at hand is whether the deception is justified. The new pharmacist must also decide if he will abide by his employer's orders.
