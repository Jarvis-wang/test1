The following is one example of a very good ethics paper. Note that the models and theories cited are thoroughly explained, and their implications to the case are fully explored. This paper does not, of course, represent the only way a good paper could be written, but it does demonstrate one successful strategy. Some comments pointing out the strengths of the paper are placed in the right margin

The author chooses to state the case in full in italics. An alternative would be to paraphrase the important facts of the case

Dorothy Abraham suffered from colon cancer. She was in acute pain for nearly three years. Her physician, Dr. Martha Little, prescribed a narcotic analgesic for the debilitating affliction. Abraham also experienced insomnia so Little gave her a barbiturate to help her sleep. Abraham was able to discontinue use of the analgesic, but became addicted to the sleeping drug. Realizing this addiction, Little made an arrangement with her patient's pharmacist to replace, in stages, the original barbiturate formula with a sugar substance. The barbiturate manufacturer provided the pharmacist with the empty patent capsules so Abraham would not suspect anything. The pharmacist gradually increased the sugar in the capsules while decreasing the barbiturate. After one year, Abraham was unknowingly paying full price for a placebo. The pharmacist could have easily charged Abraham more due to his labor, but knowing her financial situation, decided against it. Little still treated Abraham and wrote her the barbiturate prescription each month. Also aware of her financial status, she charged Abraham less than usual. Little also justified the cheaper rate because she thought if she did not charge Abraham, the therapeutic placebo would no longer be effective.

The pharmacist explained the situation and asked his new employee to fill the placebo prescription. The pharmacist suggested that it would be detrimental if Abraham were to find out she had been given a placebo. The new pharmacist was bothered by his boss's demand. He reasoned that the insomnia may return, she could really become addicted, and she would lose faith in her doctor. But, he was alsotroubled by the fact that Abraham was spending so much money for nothing more than sugar. The employee was not at all sure that he wanted to be a part of the scheme to deceive the woman. He found the idea of tricking Abraham to be inconsistent with his duties and demeaning to patients (Callahan 167-8).

A clearstatement ofthe ethicalissue at stake is offered.

Obviously, Abraham was deceived. Little, the first pharmacist, and the manufacturer each knowingly played a role in leading her to believing a falsehood. The issue at hand is whether the deception is justified. The new pharmacist must also decide if he will abide by his employer's orders.

Brief paragraphs state the two opposing ethical positions that could be taken in the case.

One could say that Abraham's addiction was handled in the most ideal way possible by all professionals involved; that the lies were justified. Not knowing the truth may have been in Abraham's best interest and did cure her of the barbiturate addiction.

On the other hand, one could argue that the professionals committed a wrong when they tricked Abraham. There may have been other ways to treat the patient's addiction that would not require betraying her trust, but would produce the same result. Other options involving honesty were not considered.

Notice the order of discussion. First a prima facie principle is offered as an initial justification for the position, and then adeeper theoretical justification along the same lines of reasoning is offered using act utilitarianism.

The first claim, that the situation was handled properly, is justifiable. The basic moral principle of beneficence provides guidance here. As a moral agent, and especially as a physician, Little is obligated to do anything that improves the overall state of another person's life. This also includes preventing harm from happening to others. The doctor had every intention of helping her patient when she initially prescribed the sleeping drug. The pills cured Abraham of her insomnia. Little also felt that weaning Abraham off the barbiturate, to which she was psychologically addicted, was in her patient's best interest. The first pharmacist and the barbiturate manufacturer agreed and willingly provided the placebo. The look-alike pills also helped Abraham retain normal sleeping patterns. On the other hand, one could argue that the professionals committed a wrong when they tricked Abraham. There may have been other ways to treat the patient's addiction that would not require betraying her trust, but would produce the same result. Other options involving honesty were not considered.

Specific facts of the case are cited when drawing out the implications of the application of act utilitarianism to the case.

According to utilitarianism, an influential normative ethical theory, moral agents should seek to produce the greatest possible balance of good over evil, or the least possible balance of evil over good, for everyone who will be affected by the actions. The outcomes of the action determine its moral status. Act utilitarianism is one form of the theory. This teleological theory states that the agent's actions should lead to the best consequences overall that are possible for each situation where the act will have significant effect. Moral agents predict possible consequences and then perform the one action that will produce the best results. If the principle of utility were applied in the former case, each of the moral agents would first predict the consequences of their possible actions. Next, they would weigh the alternatives together and act upon their best assessment. The main consequence each would probably consider to be top priority would be the health and welfare of the patient. It is evident that it is in Abraham's best interest to get an adequate amount of sleep. If she were to continue suffering from insomnia it could be detrimental to her physical and emotional well-being. Dr. Little acted in the best interest of her patient when she originally prescribed the barbiturates. The pills provided the most desirable consequence by ending Abraham's sleepless nights. It is also clear that an addiction to any drug is not healthy. The secret arrangement between Little and the pharmacist led to the extinction of the addiction. Even though Abraham didn't realize it, she benefitted from Little's actions.


Two alternative justifying models are then considered. The author in each case offers some criticism of the use of the models to justify the deception. This critique supports her eventual position that the deception was morally impermissible.

Normative models, meant to decipher the issues of authority and relative personal involvement, also apply to the way this professional/client relationship was handled. There is a certain unpredictability in most professional/client relationships, especially medical examples. For this reason, the covenant model is often applied. This model states that the professional has an additional responsibility to meet the needs and requirements and address the problems of their client even when not covered by the initial agreements of the relationship. Thismodel protects the client by requiring the professional to go further. To a certain degree, the covenant model applies in this case. Neither Little nor Abraham assumed, when entering the relationship, that the patient would experience insomnia or become addicted to a prescription drug. The doctor fulfilled her role in the covenant model to the extent that she went beyond the anticipated needs of her patient and addressed the new concerns as they arose. She prescribed medication and then helped alleviate Abraham's addiction. The pharmacist also went further than the original tacit agreement with his customer. He knew of her addiction and assisted in treating it. Neither the physician nor the pharmacist completely fulfilled their roles in the covenant model because they did not gain approval or disapproval from the client. In fact, the professionals didn't even notify the client of her condition or the fact that they were treating it

It could also be said that the professional/client relationship could be better represented by the paternalism model. This would also only be true in some aspects. In the paternalism model, the professional has all the authority and responsibility. The model is comparable to the link between parent and child. It is only applicable when the client is weak and can't be expected to make decisions to promote his or her interests. Then it is the more knowledgeable professional's responsibility to take action without the client's consent. Both of the professionals and the manufacturer applied this model to the situation when they decided to replace the barbiturate with a sugar substance without Abraham’s consent. None of the parties involved had any reason to believe that Abraham could not make a good decision regarding her condition. This robbed the patient of her autonomy.

Here the author begins to offer support for the contrary position. 
If the professionals had applied different moral principles, the results would very likely have been different. The principle of honesty, stating that agents have the moral obligation to tell the truth, was ignored. Each played a part in deceiving Abraham. It is easy for professmnals to do this because clients tend to be less knowledgeable, especially in the subject that they have hired the professional to help them with. Abraham may not have been directly lied to, but she was tricked into believing that she was taking the drug that was originally prescribed to her.

Note that the author adopts the same order of discussion for supporting this position as she did for the previous: justifying prima facie principles followed by applicable ethical theories and normative models.

The principle of autonomy, otherwise known as the moral value of liberty, is also applicable to Abraham's situation. She has the freedom to live her life as she sees fit. The right of noninterference, part of this principle, states that others should not try to control our lives or decisions. The professionals’ actions reflected just the opposite viewpoint. They regulated all of Abraham's judgments regarding her medication. She was not even given a chance to make essential decisions, because she was not made aware of her condition.

Utilitarianism could also apply as a means of correcting the deceitful ways in which the professional characters acted. Rule utilitarianism is one form of the theory. This version states that the society ought to adopt rules of action, which if consistently followed by everyone, would achieve the best possible outcome. Once a rule is adopted moral agents are obligated to follow it consistently. They do not look at particular situations, but categories where the rule can be permissibly executed. As a general rule, most societies perceive lying as wrong. If lying were condoned in a society it would have a drastic effect on its citizens. Trust would quickly be strewn away as a thing of the past. Therefore a rule that prohibits lying should be adopted in both professional and ordinary settings. Once a rule is adopted, there can be no exceptions. Little and the pharmacist made a deviation of this rule when they were not truthful with Abraham. The odds are that neither of these professional would appreciate being deceived. Thus, they would agree that the "no lying" rule is appropriate. Yet, they have made themselves exempt from the policy. Abraham also probably abides by and appreciates the unwritten rule. If she were aware of her trusted professional's actions, she would likely feel a strong sense of betrayal.

Kantianism, the first of two deontological theories, can similarly be applied. German philosopher Immanual Kant said the moral status of an action is not determined by its consequences. According to him, moral agents are obligated to perform those actions that accord with the fundamental demand that agents should treat others, and themselves, in a way that is consistent with human dignity. Deceiving Abraham may have been led to a better outcome than telling the truth, but according to Kantianism the professionals were still required to be honest because the act of lying does not show respect for the patient. In what he called the categorical imperative, Kant said that individuals take on guides for their behavior called maxims. If a maxim can be universalized as a law, it is permissible. If it is irrational to want everyone to accept the maxim, then it is a contradiction of will and the individual should adopt the opposite of the original maxim. Little and the pharmacist may have adopted the personal maxim that deception is justified. It is clear that once they tested the rule of action that they would determine deception to be impermissible. According to Kant, upon discovering this, they ought to adopt the opposite maxim which suggests that they not lie or deceive.

The ethical theory contractarianism, or contractualism, ideally states that ethical obligations are consequences of contracts involving hypothetical consent. The agreements are not actual, but represent those that moral agents would rationally make in relationships for their mutual benefit. It is assumed that a professional and client would both agree to be honest with each other so the relationship can best fulfill its purpose. It is likely that Abraham rationally made this assumption when entering both the bond with her physician and the one with her pharmacist. It would definitely be in her best interest to be honest and not withhold information from either of the professionals. For example, she should inform each of them of any allergies, other medication she is taking, and possibly other factors dealing with her health history. Without this information, the professionals could unknowingly make costly errors. When Abraham disclosed this vital information she assumed that her doctor and pharmacist would do the same for her by divulging any pertinent information. By not informing Abraham of her condition or treatment, each of them breached their part of the contract.

The author offers here a reasonable judgment concerning a risk of applying the model, suggesting how caution should be applied.

The professionals in this case should have considered alternative normative models when dealing with the appropriate degree of authority and personal involvement. The contract model may have been an effective way to handle the situation differently. It states that the professional and client should have equal authority. The client and the professional are considered to be separate agents entering a relationship in their own interest. (Ideally each party can protect themselves during the negotiation leading to an agreement. Commonly, the playing field is not even. The professional is likely to have the upper hand, but should not use this bias against the client he or she is serving.) The judgments must be mutual. If Little would have used this model with Abraham, she would have been forced to talk to her about her viewpoints on various treatments, honesty, and addiction. The barrier placed on impersonal, technical thinking would have made the relationship more equal, where each party had a say in what would happen. Little would not have been able to treat Abraham in the manner she did, because the two had not even discussed the situation let alone come to an agreement. The pharmacist would have also informed Abraham of the type of medication she was taking daily and its effects.

Note that the author offers a number of perspectives here, based on different normative theories and models. This provides a fuller treatment of the case than if only one perspective were offered.

The covenant model, presented earlier, takes the contract model one step further. It is important that professionals in the medical field strive to fulfill this role because of the unforseeable nature of the patient's health. A patient needs to be able count on his contract. Abraham probably expected this treatment from her long-time doctor and pharmacist. Knowing she could count on them to protect her, would provide security that any patient would appreciate.

The friendship or collegial model would also have given the circumstances a different turn. It suggests that the professional treat his or her client with thesame personal concern they would have for a friend. It disregards the need for an initial contract because the professional should address the issues in the best possible way out of personal regard. The professional is obhgated to meet the chent’s needs as they arise, even if doing so goes against the initial agreement. In fulfilling the role of a one-way friend, Little and the pharmacist would have felt a sense of loyalty to Abraham. It is generally understood that one should not deceive or trick a friend. So, the professionals would have thought twice before making the secret arrangement

The author now offers her explicit endorsement of the second position, and makes some additional points supporting that position as well as comments on what she regards as the weaknesses of the alternative view.

The standards of professional and ordinary morality should be the same. In my opinion, professionals are no more iustified in deceiving people than others are. Just because lies were not told outright, does not excuse hiding the truth. The characters in this case were looking at the ends or consequences only. Just because the addiction was cured, does not mean the professionals treated it in the best manner. If Abraham had been aware of her addiction, she may have even been able to quit taking the barbiturates cold turkey, saving her hundreds of dollars. Another possibility would have been to inform her of the addiction and the treatment where she would be weaned off the pills when this transformation period was over. If that did not work, she could have actively sought an alternative treatment with her doctor and/or pharmacist. The medical professionals betrayed Abraham's trust and robbed her of her autonomy when they had no reason to believe that she was unable to make good decisions. Knowing the truth is in any client's best interest. It could significantly alter any decisions he or she could be faced with.

The new pharmacist should refuse to be a part of the plot to deceive Abraham. He ought explain his reasons for not filling the placebo prescription to help his boss better understand and to remind him to reevaluate his duties as a pharmacist. Hopefully, he will be able to state his side of the issue so that his employer respects his opinion enough to honor it and not force him to fill the fictitious prescription. He should not, however, tell Abraham that she has been deceived. I t is not the newcomer to the situation's responsibility to fix the other's mistakes. And the effects of the realization of betrayal could be damaging to her opinion of medical professionals, especially those who know her condition and history very well.
